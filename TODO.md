# TODOs

- Globally test the randomness fix
- Relaunch Bloggers experiment with a more powerful server (and then with as many documents as possible)
- [FOR FINAL VERSION] Relaunch all experiments with correct randomness (and regenerate the plots)
- [FOR CODE SOURCE PUBLICATION] Add docstrings to state which scripts is associated to which figure in the paper.
